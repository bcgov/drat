# drat - bcgov R package ðŸ“¦ repository

We are using the [drat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drat) R package to 
set up the infrastructure for a mini bcgov R package repository.

The intent is to make it easy for bcgov R users to install bcgov R packages, and
keep them up to date.

### Usage

#### Package Users: Installation of bcgov R packages

The easiest way to set yourself up to use this drat repository is to first 
install the **drat** package:

```r
install.packages("drat")
```

Then add the bcgov drat repo to your list of repositories to install from:

```r
drat::addRepo("bcgov")
```

Add the above line to your `.Rprofile` file so that the bcgov drat repository is 
available every time you run **R**.

Now you can install a package from the bcgov repository with `install.packages()`.
For example:

```r
install.packages("bcgovr")
```

#### Package Authors: Adding a package to the bcgov drat repository.

On the command line:

1. Clone this repository to your machine, open the directory, and checkout the
`gh-pages` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/drat
cd drat
git checkout gh-pages
```

2. Move to the directory in which your package directory resides, and build the package:

```
R CMD build "mypkg-directory"
```

3. Open R, and use the `drat::insertPackage()` function to add the built package 
(`tar.gz` file) to the drat repo:

```r
drat::insertPackage("mypackage_0.01.tar.gz", "path/to/drat")
```

*If you comfortable, you can add the argument `commit = TRUE` to the above function
call and it will automatically commit the changes that add the package to the `gh-pages` 
branch in the drat repository. Otherwise, go to step 4:*

4. Back on the command line, navigate into the drat directory, and checkout the
`gh-pages` branch:

```
cd drat
git checkout gh-pages
```

Then visually verify that the package has been added in `src/contrib`, then add, 
commit, and push the changes.
